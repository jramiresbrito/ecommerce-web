# E-COMMERCE FRONT-END

This respository contains the front-end project of my e-commerce API developed using Ruby on Rails. This is a showcase project, also used to study new technologies such as [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) and improve my [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) knowledge.

The API can be found on the link: [E-Commerce API](https://github.com/jramiresbrito/ecommerce-api)

## This project is under development
